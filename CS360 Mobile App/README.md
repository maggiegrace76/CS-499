## CS360 Mobile App — Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

### Artifact Overview
This artifact is an Android inventory management application originally developed in **CS360: Mobile Architecture and Programming**. The application allows users to register, log in, and manage inventory items through a mobile interface.

For the CS499 capstone, this artifact was enhanced to demonstrate improved software design, application structure, and user interaction.

### Rationale for Inclusion
This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and enhance a functional mobile application using object-oriented programming concepts and Android development practices.

The project highlights my experience with:
- Activity lifecycle management
- User authentication logic
- UI design and navigation
- Input validation and error handling
- Code organization and maintainability

---

### Enhancements Implemented
The following enhancements were made as part of the CS499 capstone:

- Reorganized project structure to improve readability and maintainability
- Implemented user login and registration functionality
- Improved navigation and flow between activities
- Added input validation to prevent invalid or empty data entries
- Improved error handling and user feedback through messaging
- Added in-line comments and documentation to improve code clarity

These enhancements improved the usability, reliability, and overall structure of the application.

### Reflection on the Enhancement Process
Enhancing this artifact reinforced the importance of clean architecture and thoughtful application design. One challenge was refactoring existing code while maintaining correct activity references and layout connections. Resolving these issues improved my debugging skills and understanding of Android project structure.

This process helped me focus not only on functionality, but also on writing clear, maintainable, and well-documented code that aligns with professional standards.

### Course Outcomes Addressed
This artifact demonstrates achievement of the following CS499 program outcomes:

- Design and develop computing solutions using software engineering principles
- Use appropriate tools and technologies to implement a mobile application
- Apply defensive programming techniques through input validation
- Communicate technical concepts through clear documentation and code comments

---

### Files Included
- Original CS360 project files
- Enhanced CS499 version of the application
- Supporting documentation and narratives

This artifact represents my growth in mobile application development and my ability to enhance existing software to meet academic and professional expectations.
