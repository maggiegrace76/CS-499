## Original CS360 Mobile App

This folder represents the starting point for the CS360 Mobile App artifact used in my CS 499 capstone.

The original project materials were incomplete, so much of the baseline functionality had to be recreated before enhancements could be applied. This included rebuilding core activity structure, restoring UI components, and re-establishing basic application flow.

While limited in scope compared to the enhanced version, this original state provided a foundation for demonstrating growth in software design, organization, and functionality throughout the capstone process.

Comparing this version to the enhanced artifact highlights the progress made in code structure, user interaction, validation, and overall application quality.
