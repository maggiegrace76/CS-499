## Code Review

### Overview
This section contains an informal code review completed as part of the CS 499 capstone project. The purpose of this review was to examine the original versions of selected artifacts, explain existing functionality, identify areas for improvement, and outline the enhancements later implemented for the final ePortfolio.

The intended audience for this review is peers or a technical manager. The focus of the video is on explaining how the code works, where improvements could be made, and why specific enhancements were selected.

### Artifacts Reviewed
The following artifacts are reviewed in the video:

- CS360 Mobile App (Android inventory application)
- CS340 CRUD Database application

---

### Existing Functionality
In the code review video, I walk through the original functionality of each artifact:

- The CS360 Mobile App demonstrated basic navigation between activities, user interaction through input fields, and inventory-related features.
- The CS340 CRUD Database application implemented create, read, update, and delete operations for structured data.

Both artifacts were functional in their original form, but the review identified opportunities to improve structure, clarity, and reliability.

---

### Code Analysis
During the review, I identified several areas that could be improved:

- Project organization and package structure
- Input validation and user error handling
- Separation of concerns between logic and data handling
- Code readability and documentation
- Overall maintainability of the applications

These observations guided the enhancement decisions made later in the capstone.

---

### Planned Enhancements
Based on the code analysis discussed in the video, the following enhancements were planned and later implemented:

- Refactoring code to improve organization and readability
- Improving input validation to prevent invalid or empty values
- Enhancing navigation and user interaction flow in the mobile application
- Improving data handling logic in the CRUD application
- Adding in-line comments and documentation for clarity

Each enhancement was selected to align with CS 499 course outcomes and professional software development practices.

### Course Outcomes Alignment

This code review and the resulting enhancements demonstrate my achievement of multiple CS 499 program outcomes through practical analysis, reflection, and implementation. First, I designed and evaluated computing solutions by reviewing existing application code, identifying limitations in structure, usability, and data handling, and proposing targeted enhancements aligned with professional software development standards. This process required evaluating trade-offs between simplicity, maintainability, and functionality while improving overall system design.

Second, I demonstrated professional communication skills by clearly explaining the original functionality of each artifact, outlining areas for improvement, and justifying enhancement decisions in a way that could be understood by both technical and nontechnical audiences. The code review video and supporting documentation emphasize clarity, organization, and intentional design choices, which are essential for effective collaboration and stakeholder communication in real-world development environments.

In addition, this work reflects the application of a security mindset through defensive programming considerations. During the review and enhancement planning, I identified potential risks related to user input, authentication logic, and data handling. Enhancements incorporated validation, controlled data access, and permission awareness to reduce the likelihood of misuse or unintended behavior, demonstrating an understanding of secure software design principles.

Finally, this code review highlights my ability to use appropriate tools, techniques, and industry practices to improve existing software. By working within established development environments and refining application structure, database interactions, and logic flow, I delivered enhancements that add practical value while maintaining readability and scalability. Together, these efforts demonstrate my readiness to apply computer science principles in professional settings and contribute meaningfully to real-world software projects.
