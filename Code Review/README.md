## Code Review

### Overview
This section contains an informal code review completed as part of the CS 499 capstone project. The purpose of this review was to examine the original versions of selected artifacts, explain existing functionality, identify areas for improvement, and outline the enhancements later implemented for the final ePortfolio.

The intended audience for this review is peers or a technical manager. The focus of the video is on explaining how the code works, where improvements could be made, and why specific enhancements were selected.

### Artifacts Reviewed
The following artifacts are reviewed in the video:

- CS360 Mobile App (Android inventory application)
- CS340 CRUD Database application

---

### Existing Functionality
In the code review video, I walk through the original functionality of each artifact:

- The CS360 Mobile App demonstrated basic navigation between activities, user interaction through input fields, and inventory-related features.
- The CS340 CRUD Database application implemented create, read, update, and delete operations for structured data.

Both artifacts were functional in their original form, but the review identified opportunities to improve structure, clarity, and reliability.

---

### Code Analysis
During the review, I identified several areas that could be improved:

- Project organization and package structure
- Input validation and user error handling
- Separation of concerns between logic and data handling
- Code readability and documentation
- Overall maintainability of the applications

These observations guided the enhancement decisions made later in the capstone.

---

### Planned Enhancements
Based on the code analysis discussed in the video, the following enhancements were planned and later implemented:

- Refactoring code to improve organization and readability
- Improving input validation to prevent invalid or empty values
- Enhancing navigation and user interaction flow in the mobile application
- Improving data handling logic in the CRUD application
- Adding in-line comments and documentation for clarity

Each enhancement was selected to align with CS 499 course outcomes and professional software development practices.

### Course Outcomes Alignment
This code review supports the following CS 499 program outcomes:

- Designing and evaluating computing solutions using professional standards
- Communicating technical concepts clearly to diverse audiences
- Applying a security mindset through defensive programming considerations
- Using appropriate tools and techniques to improve existing software

This code review provided the foundation for the enhancements made to both the CS360 and CS340 artifacts and demonstrates my ability to critically evaluate and improve existing software systems.
