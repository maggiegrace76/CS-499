## CS340 CRUD Database — Databases and Algorithms Enhancement

### Artifact Overview
This artifact is a CRUD-based application originally developed in **CS340: Advanced Programming Concepts**. The project focuses on performing create, read, update, and delete operations on structured data using a database-backed approach.

For the CS499 capstone, this artifact was enhanced to demonstrate improved database interaction, cleaner program structure, and more reliable data handling.

### Rationale for Inclusion
This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and work with database-driven applications while applying algorithmic thinking to manage and manipulate data effectively.

The project highlights my experience with:
- Database-backed application design
- CRUD operations
- Modular programming practices
- Input validation and data integrity
- Logical data processing

---

### Enhancements Implemented
The following enhancements were made as part of the CS499 capstone:

- Refactored code to improve modularity and readability
- Improved CRUD functionality to ensure consistent and reliable data operations
- Added input validation to prevent invalid or incomplete data from being processed
- Improved separation of concerns between database logic and application logic
- Enhanced documentation and in-line comments to clarify program behavior
- Improved error handling to make the application more robust

These enhancements improved the overall maintainability, reliability, and clarity of the application while reinforcing proper database usage.

---

### Reflection on the Enhancement Process
Enhancing this artifact strengthened my understanding of how databases integrate with application logic. One challenge was ensuring that CRUD operations behaved correctly across different user inputs while maintaining clean and readable code.

This process reinforced the importance of validating data before it reaches the database and designing code that can be easily extended or maintained. It also improved my confidence in working with structured data and database-driven workflows.

### Course Outcomes Addressed
This artifact demonstrates achievement of the following CS499 program outcomes:

- Design and evaluate computing solutions that rely on database-driven logic
- Apply algorithmic reasoning to manage and process structured data
- Use appropriate tools and techniques to implement CRUD functionality
- Apply defensive programming practices to protect data integrity
- Communicate technical concepts through clear documentation and organization

---

### Files Included
- Original CS340 project files
- Enhanced CS499 version of the application
- Supporting documentation and narratives

This artifact represents my growth in database-focused application development and my ability to enhance existing systems to meet academic and professional standards.
