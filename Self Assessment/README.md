## Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and developing this ePortfolio for CS 499 has allowed me to reflect on my academic growth, technical skill development, and professional readiness. This capstone experience brought together concepts from across the program and challenged me to evaluate, enhance, and clearly communicate my work in a professional format.

Throughout the program, I developed a strong foundation in software development, problem solving, and data-driven thinking. Creating this ePortfolio helped me identify how individual courses contributed to my overall skill set and how those skills apply to real-world computing solutions. The process of revisiting and enhancing prior artifacts reinforced the importance of maintainable code, thoughtful design, and clear documentation.

### Collaboration and Communication
Collaboration and communication were essential throughout the Computer Science program. Many courses required interpreting project requirements, responding to feedback, and clearly explaining technical decisions. In CS 499, communication was especially important through the creation of written narratives and an informal code review video. These elements required me to articulate how my code functions, identify areas for improvement, and explain the reasoning behind enhancements in a way that would be understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Developing this ePortfolio strengthened my ability to present technical work in a structured and professional manner, a skill that is critical when communicating with stakeholders, team members, or potential employers.

### Software Engineering and Design
The CS360 Mobile App artifact demonstrates my growth in software design and engineering. Enhancing this application required me to reorganize code, improve application flow, and ensure that user interactions were handled cleanly and predictably. I focused on improving readability, input validation, and activity navigation while maintaining functionality.

This enhancement process reinforced the importance of modular design, defensive programming, and writing code that is both functional and maintainable. These practices are essential for developing software that can scale or be extended in the future.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
Algorithmic thinking was applied across multiple courses and is demonstrated most clearly in the CS340 CRUD Database artifact. Enhancing this project required careful consideration of how data is processed, validated, and manipulated through create, read, update, and delete operations.

By refining logic flow and improving input validation, I strengthened my ability to reason through algorithmic processes and ensure consistent outcomes. This experience reinforced the importance of structured problem solving and efficient data handling in application development.

### Databases
Database concepts are represented through the CS340 artifact, which focuses on CRUD functionality and structured data management. Enhancing this project allowed me to improve database interaction logic, enforce data integrity, and separate database operations from application logic.

Working with database-backed applications helped me understand how data persistence supports application functionality and how improper handling of data can impact reliability. This experience strengthened my confidence in designing and maintaining database-driven systems.

### Security Mindset
Security considerations were integrated throughout my enhancements. I applied defensive programming techniques such as input validation, controlled data access, and error handling to reduce the risk of invalid or unexpected behavior. While these projects are academic in scope, applying a security mindset helped reinforce best practices that are transferable to professional environments.

### Portfolio Integration
The artifacts included in this ePortfolio work together to demonstrate my growth across the core areas of the Computer Science program. The CS360 Mobile App highlights software design and application structure, while the CS340 CRUD Database emphasizes data management and algorithmic reasoning. The code review and narratives provide insight into my thought process and ability to evaluate and improve my own work.

Together, these components present a cohesive view of my technical abilities and professional development.

### Professional Goals
This ePortfolio reflects my readiness to enter the computer science field and continue developing my skills in software development and data-focused roles. The capstone experience helped me build confidence in my ability to analyze existing systems, implement meaningful improvements, and communicate technical concepts effectively.

Overall, CS 499 provided an opportunity to demonstrate not only what I have learned, but how I can apply that knowledge in a structured, professional, and practical way.
