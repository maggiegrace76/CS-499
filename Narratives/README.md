# Narratives and Planning Documents

This folder contains the written materials created throughout **CS 499** that support the development of my capstone ePortfolio. These documents include journal entries, planning notes, and reflection drafts completed during the course.

The files in this folder document my thought process, decision-making, and progress while enhancing the CS360 and CS340 artifacts. They show how ideas evolved over time and how feedback and iteration shaped the final enhanced projects included in the portfolio.

These materials are provided as supporting context for the final enhancement narratives and technical artifacts presented in the ePortfolio.
